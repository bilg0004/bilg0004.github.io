        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><em>Hi!</em> I am Esin. I am from Turkey. I have four years of experience in data analysis. I have worked as a data analyst. I mostly used Power BI, <abbr title="Structure Query Language">SQL</abbr>, and Excel for my work. Companies I have worked with respectively are HDI Insurance company, Anex Tour, and Corendon Airlines. </p>
        
        <p>Besides my profession, in my leisure time, I really like to hang out with my friends and my family. I love nature, running, and photography. Nature helps me get to relax and stay in the moment. Also, cooking is my favorite day-to-day activity. Trying a new recipe is exciting, and fun! </p>
